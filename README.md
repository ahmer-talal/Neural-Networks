# Neural Network & Deep Learning Practice – Google Colab Notebooks

This repository contains my **Google Colab practice notebooks** created while learning and implementing **various Neural Network architectures** including **ANN, CNN, and RNN** using **TensorFlow / Keras**.

The main focus of this repository is to move from **theory to practical implementation** across different types of datasets and tasks, including both **built-in datasets** like MNIST and custom datasets.
